<h1>SKYCAST<h1></h1>

SkyCast is a simple and effective tool for obtaining current weather data for any location, built using Java and the OpenWeatherMap API.

<h3>Inspiration</h3><br>
The inspiration behind SkyCast stemmed from the need for a quick and easy way to access weather forecasts for any location. We aimed to create a user-friendly solution to fulfill this need.

<h3>What it does</h3>br>
SkyCast allows users to input a city name and retrieve the current weather conditions for that location. Leveraging the OpenWeatherMap API, users can access up-to-date weather information with just a few clicks.

<h3>How we built it</h3> <br>
SkyCast was built using Java and the OpenWeatherMap API. The core functionality involves making HTTP requests to the API endpoint, parsing the JSON response, and presenting the weather data to the user in a readable format.

<h3>Challenges we ran into</h3><br>
One challenge we encountered was handling various types of weather data returned by the API and formatting it consistently. Additionally, managing user input and error handling posed some difficulties during development.

<h3>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h3><br>
We're proud to have successfully implemented a functional weather forecasting tool in Java. Despite the challenges faced, we were able to deliver a reliable solution that meets our initial goals.

<h3>What we learned</h3><br>
Through the development of SkyCast, we gained experience in working with external APIs, parsing JSON data, and handling HTTP requests in Java. We also improved our skills in user input validation and error handling.

<h3>What's next for SkyCast</h3><br>
In the future, we plan to enhance SkyCast by adding more features such as extended weather forecasts, customizable units, and graphical representations of weather data. We also aim to improve the user interface for a more intuitive user experience.
